# WineMLPractice

This project was for a class. It was an exploration of ML algorithms in predicting good vs bad wine. The data was cleaned, transformed, and aggregated. As well, there was some visual analysis made based on the strongest correlated columns. Then the algorithms: Logisitic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forrest, xgboost, and two Neural Networks with different packages were used in classification of the wine by rating. It was found that the random forrest classifier model was the strongest predictor.
